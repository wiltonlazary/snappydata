hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
This test starts the snappy cluster.
Test then runs the sql script for creating and loading data in schema used to test the Spark SQL driver.
It then executes the sql statement (DROP DATABASE...CASCADE) to drop the database along with all tables.
And immediately after certain time interval it fires cancel for the above statement to stop the execution.
The intention is to reproduce the catalog consistency issue which then causes the lead node going down and failing to restart";
