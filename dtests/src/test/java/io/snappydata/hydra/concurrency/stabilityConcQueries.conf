hydra.Prms-testRequirement = "Test to identify Stability at Scale when the data size in a cluster is more than 1 TB
 and then running ad hoc queries through various clients e.g. Tibco spotFire and 4-5 JDBC clients";
hydra.Prms-testDescription = "
Test includes 5 schemas with varying data scale such that the data size in a cluster is more than 1 TB and then
running ad hoc queries through various clients e.g. Tibco spotFire and 4-5 JDBC clients.
The queries will be running continuously for more than 2-3 days to test the cluster stability.
All the clients will pick a random query from the inc file and run it on the external tables, snappy tables, etc.

Schemas used:
1. patients(we have synthea data generator to generate data and around 60-70 analytical queries on this dataset)
2. Airline (with 2 tables and involving join queries on these tables - around 20-25 unique analytical queries and few point lookup queries)
3. NYC Taxi (schema with set of unique queries - around 20)
4. Reviews (with 20-25 complex ad hoc queries including analytical queries and few point lookup queries)
5. TPCH ( with 22 analytical queries)

External data sources used:
1. Parquet
2. CSV

Cluster configuration details:
Servers: 5-6 data servers each on a seperate physical host
Leads: 1 node
Locators: 1 node
Buckets: default
Redundancy:0

MALLOC settings:
 MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=4
 MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_=2147483647
 MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_=131072
