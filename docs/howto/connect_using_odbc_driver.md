## Step 2: Installing TIBCO ComputeDB ODBC Driver

To download and install the ODBC driver:

1. Download the drivers zip file **TIB_compute_drivers_1.2.0_linux.zip** using the steps provided [here](/quickstart/getting_started_by_installing_snappydata_on-premise.md). After this file is  extracted, you will find that it contains the ODBC installers in another file **TIB_compute-odbc_1.2.0_win.zip**. 
2. Extract **TIB_compute-odbc_1.2.0_win.zip**. Depending on your Windows installation, extract the contents of the 32-bit or 64-bit version of the TIBCO ComputeDB ODBC Driver.

    | Version | ODBC Driver |
    |--------|--------|
    |32-bit for 32-bit platform|TIB_compute-odbc_1.2.0_win_x86.zip|
    |64-bit for 64-bit platform|TIB_compute-odbc_1.2.0_win_x64.zip|

4. Double-click on the corresponding **msi** file, and follow the steps to complete the installation.

	!!! Note
		Ensure that [TIBCO ComputeDB is installed](../install.md) and the [TIBCO ComputeDB cluster is running](start_snappy_cluster.md).

## Connecting to the TIBCO ComputeDB Cluster 
Once you have installed the TIBCO ComputeDB ODBC Driver, you can connect to TIBCO ComputeDB cluster in any of the following ways:

* Use the TIBCO ComputeDB Driver Connection URL:

		Driver=TIBCO ComputeDB ODBC Driver;server=<ServerIP>;port=<ServerPort>;user=<userName>;password=<password> 
	        
* Create a TIBCO ComputeDB DSN (Data Source Name) using the installed TIBCO ComputeDB ODBC Driver. Refer to the Windows documentation relevant to your operating system for more information on creating a DSN. </br>
When prompted, select the TIBCO ComputeDB ODBC Driver from the list of drivers and enter a Data Source name, TIBCO ComputeDB Server Host, Port, User Name and Password.
Refer to the documentation for detailed information on [Setting Up TIBCO ComputeDB ODBC Driver](../setting_up_odbc_driver-tableau_desktop.md).
